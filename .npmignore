# Ignore files that you don't want consumers to have to download
# By default, the following paths and files are ignored, so there's no need to add them to .npmignore explicitly:
#
#   .*.swp
#   ._*
#   .DS_Store
#   .git
#   .hg
#   .npmrc
#   .lock-wscript
#   .svn
#   .wafpickle-*
#   config.gypi
#   CVS
#   npm-debug.log
#   node_modules
